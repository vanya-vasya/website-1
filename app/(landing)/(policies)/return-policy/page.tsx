                    At Neuvisia.com, we strive to provide high-quality AI
                    generation services that meet your needs. However, if you
                    are not satisfied with your purchase, we offer a return
                    policy for unused generations. This policy is designed to
                    ensure that you have a positive experience with our platform
                    and feel confident in your purchases.

                  <p className="career-page-top__text-1 pt-4">
                    You may return any unused generations within 14 days of the
                    purchase date for a full refund. This return policy applies
                    to all generation packages available on our website. Please
                    read the following conditions carefully to understand the
                    requirements for returning unused generations.

                        <strong>Unused Generations:</strong> Only generations
                        that have not been used are eligible for return. Once a
                        generation has been used, it cannot be returned or
                        refunded. We define &quot;used&quot; generations as
                        those that have been utilized in any of our AI
                        generation services, including but not limited to text
                        generation, image creation, or any other AI tool
                        provided on Neuvisia.com.

                        of the purchase date. This 14-day period begins on the
                        date you complete the purchase transaction. Requests
                        made after this period will not be considered for a
                        refund.
